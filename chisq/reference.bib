	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an explosion in the volume and variety of data collected in all scientific disciplines and industrial settings. Such massive data sets present a number of challenges to researchers in statistics and machine learning. This book provides a self-contained introduction to the area of high-dimensional statistics, aimed at the first-year graduate level. It includes chapters that are focused on core methodology and theory - including tail bounds, concentration inequalities, uniform laws and empirical process, and random matrices - as well as chapters devoted to in-depth exploration of particular model classes - including sparse linear models, matrix models with rank constraints, graphical models, and various types of non-parametric models. With hundreds of worked examples and exercises, this text is intended both for courses and for self-study by graduate students and researchers in statistics, machine learning, and related fields who must understand, apply, and adapt modern statistical methods suited to large-scale data.},

   abstract = { We consider the problem of verifying the identity of a distribution: Given the description of a distribution over a discrete finite or countably infinite support, $p=(p_1,p_2,…)$, how many samples (independent draws) must one obtain from an unknown distribution, $q$, to distinguish, with high probability, the case that $p=q$ from the case that the total variation distance ($L_1$ distance) $p-q_1  ε$? We resolve this question, up to constant factors, on an instance by instance basis: there exist universal constants $c,c'$ and a function $f(p,ε)$ on the known distribution $p$ and error parameter $ε$, such that our tester distinguishes $p=q$ from $p-q_1 ε$ using $f(p,ε)$ samples with success probability $>2/3$, but no tester can distinguish $p=q$ from $p-q_1 c ε$ when given $c' f(p,ε)$ samples. The function $f(p,ε)$ is upper-bounded by a multiple of $p\_\{2/3\}ε^2$ but is more complicated. This result generalizes and tightens previous results: since distributions of support at most $n$ have $L\_\{2/3\}$ norm bounded by $n,$ this result immediately shows that for such distributions, $O(n/ε^2)$ samples suffice, tightening the previous bound of $O(n\  polylog\ nε^4)$ and matching the (tight) results for the case that $p$ is the uniform distribution of support $n$. The analysis of our very simple testing algorithm involves several hairy inequalities. To facilitate this analysis, we give a complete characterization of a general class of inequalities—generalizing Cauchy–Schwarz, H\"{o}lder's inequality, and the monotonicity of $L_p$ norms. Specifically, we characterize the set of sequences of triples $(a,b,c)_i=(a_1,b_1,c_1),…,(a_r,b_r,c_r)$ for which it holds that for all finite sequences of positive numbers $(x)_j=x_1,…$ and $(y)_j=y_1,…,$ $\_\{i=1\}^r ( _j x_j^a_i y_j^b_i)^c_i  1.$ For example, the standard Cauchy–Schwarz inequality corresponds to the triples $(a,b,c)_i=(1,0,12),$ $(0,1,12),$ $(12,12,-1)$. Our characterization is constructive and algorithmic, leveraging linear programming to prove or refute an inequality, which would otherwise have to be investigated, through trial and error, by hand. We hope the computational nature of our characterization will be useful to others and facilitate analyses like the one here. },

Using wavelet methods we provide two shrinkage procedures based on thresholding rules for which knowledge of the regularity of the copula density to be estimated is not necessary. These methods, said to be adaptive, have proved to be very effective when adopting the minimax and the maxiset approaches. Moreover we show that these procedures can be discriminated in the maxiset sense. We provide an estimation algorithm and evaluate its properties using simulation. Finally, we propose a real life application for financial data.},

@book{multivariateSmoothing,
   abstract = {An applied treatment of the key methods and state-of-the-art tools for visualizing and understanding statistical data Smoothing of Multivariate Data provides an illustrative and hands-on approach to the multivariate aspects of density estimation, emphasizing the use of visualization tools. Rather than outlining the theoretical concepts of classification and regression, this book focuses on the procedures for estimating a multivariate distribution via smoothing. The author first provides an introduction to various visualization tools that can be used to construct representations of multivariate functions, sets, data, and scales of multivariate density estimates. Next, readers are presented with an extensive review of the basic mathematical tools that are needed to asymptotically analyze the behavior of multivariate density estimators, with coverage of density classes, lower bounds, empirical processes, and manipulation of density estimates. The book concludes with an extensive toolbox of multivariate density estimators, including anisotropic kernel estimators, minimization estimators, multivariate adaptive histograms, and wavelet estimators. A completely interactive experience is encouraged, as all examples and figurescan be easily replicated using the R software package, and every chapter concludes with numerous exercises that allow readers to test their understanding of the presented techniques. The R software is freely available on the book's related Web site along with "Code" sections for each chapter that provide short instructions for working in the R environment. Combining mathematical analysis with practical implementations, Smoothing of Multivariate Data is an excellent book for courses in multivariate analysis, data analysis, and nonparametric statistics at the upper-undergraduate and graduatelevels. It also serves as a valuable reference for practitioners and researchers in the fields of statistics, computer science, economics, and engineering.},

Obtaining an adaptive estimator of this functional component is an important practical problem in econometrics where exact distributions of random errors and the parametric component are mostly unknown. An estimator of the functional component that is adaptive over the wide range of multivariate Besov classes and robust to a wide choice of distributions of the linear component and random errors is constructed. It is also shown that the same estimator is locally adaptive over the same range of Besov classes and robust over large collections of distributions of the linear component and random errors as well. At any fixed point, this estimator attains a local adaptive minimax rate.},

   abstract = {We study the fundamental problems of identity testing (goodness of fit), and closeness testing (two sample test) of distributions over k elements, under differential privacy. While the problems have a long history in statistics, finite sample bounds for these problems have only been established recently. In this work, we derive upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of both the problems under (ε, δ)-differential privacy. We provide sample optimal algorithms for identity testing problem for all parameter ranges, and the first results for closeness testing. Our closeness testing bounds are optimal in the sparse regime where the number of samples is at most k.Our upper bounds are obtained by privatizing non-private estimators for these problems. The non-private estimators are chosen to have small sensitivity. We propose a general framework to establish lower bounds on the sample complexity of statistical tasks under differential privacy. We show a bound on differentially private algorithms in terms of a coupling between the two hypothesis classes we aim to test. By carefully constructing chosen priors over the hypothesis classes, and using Le Cam's two point theorem we provide a general mechanism for proving lower bounds. We believe that the framework can be used to obtain strong lower bounds for other statistical tasks under privacy.},

@article{Ding2017CollectingPrivately,
   abstract = {The collection and analysis of telemetry data from user's devices is routinely performed by many software companies. Telemetry collection leads to improved user experience but poses significant risks to users' privacy. Locally differentially private (LDP) algorithms have recently emerged as the main tool that allows data collectors to estimate various population statistics, while preserving privacy. The guarantees provided by such algorithms are typically very strong for a single round of telemetry collection, but degrade rapidly when telemetry is collected regularly. In particular, existing LDP algorithms are not suitable for repeated collection of counter data such as daily app usage statistics. In this paper, we develop new LDP mechanisms geared towards repeated collection of counter data, with formal privacy guarantees even after being executed for an arbitrarily long period of time. For two basic analytical tasks, mean estimation and histogram estimation, our LDP mechanisms for repeated data collection provide estimates with comparable or even the same accuracy as existing single-round LDP collection mechanisms. We conduct empirical evaluation on real-world counter datasets to verify our theoretical results. Our mechanisms have been deployed by Microsoft to collect telemetry across millions of devices.},

First, we study the general framework of mapping each user’s type into a signal and show that the problem of finding the maximum-likelihood distribution over the signals is feasible. Then we discuss the randomized-response mechanism and show that, in essence, it maps the null- and alternative-hypotheses onto new sets, an affine translation of the original sets. We then give sample complexity bounds for identity and independence testing under randomized-response. We then move to the newer non-symmetric mechanisms and show that there too the problem of finding the maximum-likelihood distribution is feasible. Under the mechanism of Bassily et al we give identity and independence testers with better sample complexity than the testers in the symmetric case, and we also propose a χ^2-based identity tester which we investigate empirically.},

While existing works put their effort into properly controlling the type-I error, in addition to that, we investigate the type-II error of differentially private mechanisms. Based on the analysis, we present unit circle mechanism: a novel differentially private mechanism based on the geometrical property of the test statistics. Compared to existing output perturbation mechanisms, our mechanism improves the dominated term of the type-II error from O(1) to O((-N)) where N is the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce novel procedures for multiple χ^2 tests by incorporating the unit circle mechanism into the sparse vector technique and the exponential mechanism. These procedures can control the family-wise error rate (FWER) properly, which has never been attained by existing mechanisms.},

In this paper, we investigate continuum-armed bandits under more general smoothness conditions, namely Besov smoothness conditions, on the objective function. In both noiseless and noisy conditions, we derive minimax rates under both simple and cumulative regrets. In particular, our results show that minimax rates over objective functions in a Besov space are identical to minimax rates over objective functions in the smallest Holder space into which the Besov space embeds. },

The class of U-statistics covers many statistical estimates of interest, including Gini mean difference, Kendall’s tau coefficient and Area under the ROC Curve (AUC), as well as empirical risk measures for machine learning problems such as ranking, clustering and metric learning. We first introduce an LDP protocol based on quantizing the data into bins and applying randomized response, which guarantees an ε-LDP estimate with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of O(1/nε) under regularity assumptions on the U-statistic or the data distribution. We then propose a specialized protocol for AUC based on a novel use of hierarchical histograms that achieves MSE of O(α^3/nε^2) for arbitrary data distribution. We also show that 2-party secure computation allows to design a protocol with MSE of O(1/nε^2), without any assumption on the kernel function or data distribution and with total communication linear in the number of users n. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our protocols through experiments on synthetic and real datasets.},
